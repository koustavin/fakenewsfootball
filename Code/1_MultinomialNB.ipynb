I think Naive Bayes is simple enough to understand, so it can be a good candidate for a baseline model. Also, since I literally started this project with MultinomialNB (https://www.kaggle.com/code/koustavin/94-acc-multinomialnb-with-diff-vectorizers) - it makes sense for me to use it as baseline and try to improve the score from there."
